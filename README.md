# haskgit

this is a personal project to follow the book [*Building Git*], but write it in Haskell
instead of the book's native Ruby. i barely knew Haskell before starting, so this was
mainly a personal project to learn Haskell as well as learn about the internals of Git. i
make no claim of the quality of the code within. i have a few Haskell friends who have
coached me through this, so this project wouldn't really be possible without them.

notable things that happened while writing this:

* [in my hubris, i posted a patch to the Haskell libraries mailing list][lib-email]
